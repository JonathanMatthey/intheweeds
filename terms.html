            <p>By accessing or using this website or any other websites of DBA In The Weeds Jobs (the “Company”), its
                affiliates or agents (collectively, the “Website”) in any way, including using the services and

                registration process, and/or browsing the website or downloading company’s mobile application
                (the “Application”), you represent that:
                <br/>

                If you subscribe to the services for a term (the “Initial Term”), then the Terms Of Use will be

                <br/>
                1.1 Account Creation.  In order to access certain features of the Website, Application and Services
                (collectively, the “Company Properties”) you may be required to become a Registered User.  For purposes
                of the Terms, a “Registered User” is a User who has registered an account on the Website (“Account”),
                has a valid account on the social networking service (“SNS”) through which the User has connected to the
                Services (each such account, a “Third-Party Account”), or has an account with the provider of the
                Application for the User’s mobile device.
                <br/>
                1.2 Access Through a SNS.  If you access the Services through a SNS as part of the functionality of the
                Website, the Application and/or the Services, you may link your Account with Third-Party Accounts, by
                allowing the Company to access your Third-Party Account, as is permitted under the applicable terms and
                conditions that govern your use of each Third-Party Account.  
                You represent that you are entitled to disclose your Third-Party Account login information to the
                Company and/or grant the Company access to your Third-Party Account (including, but not limited to, for
                use for the purposes described herein) without breach by you of any of the terms and conditions that
                govern your use of the applicable Third-Party Account and without obligating the Company to pay any fees
                or making the Company subject to any usage limitations imposed by such third-party service providers.  
                By granting the Company access to any Third-Party Accounts, you understand that the Company may access,
                make available and store (if applicable) any information, data, text, software, music, sound,
                photographs, graphics, video, messages, tags and/or other materials accessible through the Company
                Properties (“Content”) that you have provided to and stored in your Third-Party Account (“SNS Content”)
                so that it is available on and through the Company Properties via your Account.  Unless otherwise
                specified in the Terms, all SNS Content shall be considered to be Your Content (as defined in Section
                3.1) for all purposes of the Terms.  
                <br/>
                Depending on the Third-Party Accounts you choose and subject to the privacy settings that you have set
                in such Third-Party Accounts, personally identifiable information that you post to your Third-Party
                Accounts may be available on and through your Account on the Company Properties. Please note that if a
                Third-Party Account or associated service becomes unavailable or the Company’s access to such
                Third-Party Account is terminated by the third-party service provider, then SNS Content will no longer
                be available on and through the Company Properties.  
                <br/>
                You have the ability to disable the connection between your Account and your Third-Party Accounts at any
                time by accessing the “Settings” section of the Website.  PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE
                THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR
                AGREEMENT(S) WITH SUCH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS, AND COMPANY DISCLAIMS ANY LIABILITY FOR PERSONALLY
                IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION THAT MAY BE PROVIDED TO IT BY SUCH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS IN VIOLATION
                OF THE PRIVACY SETTINGS THAT YOU HAVE SET IN SUCH THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS.  The Company makes no effort to
                review any SNS Content for any purpose, including but not limited to, for accuracy, legality or
                noninfringement, and the Company is not responsible for any SNS Content.

                responsibility of the party from whom such Content originated.  This means that you, and not the
                Company, are entirely responsible for all Content that you upload, post, e-mail, transmit or otherwise
                make available (“Make Available”) through the Company Properties (“Your Content”), and that you and
                other Users of the Company Properties, and not the Company, are similarly responsible for all Content
                they Make Available through the Company Properties (“User Content”).

                3.2 No Obligation to Pre-Screen Content.  You acknowledge that the Company has no obligation to

                no expectation of privacy concerning the transmission of Your Content, including without limitation
                chat, text, or voice communications.  In the event that the Company pre-screens, refuses or removes any
                Content, you acknowledge that the Company will do so for the Company’s benefit, not yours.  Without
                limiting the foregoing, the Company shall have the right to remove any Content that violates the Terms
                or is otherwise objectionable.
                <br/>
                3.3 Storage.  Unless expressly agreed to by the Company in writing elsewhere, the Company has no
                obligation to store any of Your Content that you Make Available on the Company Properties.  The Company
                has no responsibility or liability for the deletion or accuracy of any Content, including Your Content;
                the failure to store, transmit or receive transmission of Content; or the security, privacy, storage, or
                transmission of other communications originating with or involving use of the Company Properties.
            </p>

                property right that may exist in Your Content.  
                <br/>
                4.3 License to Your Content.  Subject to any applicable account settings that you select, you grant the
                Company a fully paid, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive and
                fully sublicensable right (including any moral rights) and license to use, license, distribute,

                waived all such rights and validly and irrevocably granted to you the right to grant the license stated

                Job Postings & User Conduct
                <br/>
                5.1 Job Postings.  The Services enable users to create job postings that are accessible by others. You
                agree that you will not, or permit any third party to create any job posting that:
                <br/>
                (1) contains any URLs or other links to third party websites;
                <br/>
                (2) infringes upon or misappropriates, or otherwise violates any third party’s intellectual property
                rights, including copyrights, trademarks, and/or trade secrets, or rights of privacy/publicity;
                <br/>
                (3) uses any keywords, metatags or other “hidden text” that infringes upon any third party’s trademark
                rights or which are otherwise irrelevant to the job posting;
                <br/>
                (4) is discriminatory, or promotes discrimination, bigotry, racism, hatred, harassment or harm against
                any individual or group;
                <br/>
                (5) is violent or threatening, or promotes violence or actions that are threatening to any other person;
                <br/>
                (6) is unlawful, tortious, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, libelous, or racially, ethnically or otherwise
                objectionable;
                <br/>
                (7) is disparaging, embarrassing or offensive to any other person or entity; or
                <br/>

                (commercial or otherwise).

                Job postings must describe individual openings for traditional W-2 employees or 1099 independent
                contractors. One job position may be posted in each opening, and you agree that you shall not advertise
                or promote more than one open position per posting. Job postings must contain sufficient detail to
                convey to other users, in a clear manner, the nature and requirements of the job opportunity and may not
                encourage any users to email or otherwise inquire further with the job poster for additional details.
                You acknowledge that the Company has no obligation to pre-screen any job postings, although the Company
                reserves the right in its sole discretion to pre-screen, refuse or remove any job posting that the
                Company determines, in its sole discretion, violates this Section 5, is in the best interests of users
                or otherwise detracts from the user experience.

                Investigations
                <br/>
                The Company may, but is not obligated to, monitor or review the Company Properties and Content at any
                time.  Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to
                remove any of Your Content for any reason (or no reason), including if such Content violates the Terms
                or any applicable law.  Although the Company does not generally monitor user activity occurring in
                connection with the Company Properties or Content, if the Company becomes aware of any possible
                violations by you of any provision of the Terms, the Company reserves the right to investigate such
                violations, and the Company may, at its sole discretion, immediately terminate your license to use the
                Company Properties, or change, alter or remove Your Content, in whole or in part, without prior notice
                to you.
                <br/>

                7.1 User Responsibility.  You are solely responsible for your interactions with other Users of the
                Services and any other parties with whom you interact through the Services; provided, however, that the
                Company reserves the right, but has no obligation, to intercede in such disputes.  You agree that the
                Company will not be responsible for any liability incurred as the result of such interactions.
                <br/>
                7.2 Content Provided by Other Users.  The Company Properties may contain User Content provided by other
                Users.  The Company is not responsible for and does not control User Content.  The Company has no
                obligation to review or monitor, and does not approve, endorse or make any representations or warranties
                with respect to User Content.  You use all User Content and interact with other Users at your own risk.
                <br/>
                Third-Party Links & Ads; Other Users
                <br/>
                8.1 Third-Party Links & Ads.  The Site may contain links to third-party websites and services, and/or
                display advertisements for third parties (collectively, “Third-Party Links & Ads”).  Such Third-Party
                Links & Ads are not under the control of Company, and Company is not responsible for any Third-Party
                Links & Ads. The Company provides access to these Third-Party Links & Ads only as a convenience to you,
                and does not review, approve, monitor, endorse, warrant, or make any representations with respect to
                Third-Party Links & Ads.  
                You use all Third-Party Links & Ads at your own risk, and should apply a suitable level of caution and
                discretion in doing so. When you click on any of the Third-Party Links & Ads, the applicable third
                party’s terms and policies apply, including the third party’s privacy and data gathering practices.  You
                should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any
                transaction in connection with such Third-Party Links & Ads.
                <br/>
                8.2 App Stores.  You acknowledge and agree that the availability of the Application and the Services is
                dependent on the third party from whom you received the Application license, e.g., the Apple iPhone or
                Android app stores (“App Store”).  You acknowledge that the Terms are between you and the Company and
                not with the App Store.  The Company, not the App Store, is solely responsible for the Company
                Properties, including the Application, the content thereof, maintenance, support services, and warranty
                therefor, and addressing any claims relating thereto (e.g., product liability, legal compliance or
                intellectual property infringement).  
                In order to use the Application, you must have access to a wireless network, and you agree to pay all
                fees associated with such access.  You also agree to pay all fees (if any) charged by the App Store in
                connection with the Company Properties, including the Application.  You agree to comply with, and your
                license to use the Application is conditioned upon your compliance with, all applicable third-party
                terms of agreement (e.g., the App Store’s terms and policies) when using the Company Properties,
                including the Application. You acknowledge that the App Store (and its subsidiaries) are third-party
                beneficiaries of the Terms and will have the right to enforce them.
                Fees and Purchase Terms
                <br/>
                9.1 Payment.  You agree to pay all fees or charges to your Account in accordance with the fees, charges
                and billing terms in effect at the time a fee or charge is due and payable.  You must provide the
                Company with a valid credit card (Visa, MasterCard, or any other issuer accepted by us) or PayPal
                account (“Payment Provider”), or purchase order information as a condition to signing up for the
                Services. Your Payment Provider agreement governs your use of the designated credit card or PayPal
                account, and you must refer to that agreement and not the Terms to determine your rights and
                liabilities.  
                <br/>
                By providing the Company with your credit card number or PayPal account and associated payment
                information, you agree that the Company is authorized to immediately invoice your Account for all fees
                and charges due and payable to the Company hereunder and that no additional notice or consent is
                required.  You agree to immediately notify the Company of any change in your billing address or the
                credit card or PayPal account used for payment hereunder.  The Company reserves the right at any time to
                change its prices and billing methods, either immediately upon posting on the Company Properties or by
                e-mail delivery to you.
                <br/>
                9.2 Service Subscription Fees.  You will be responsible for payment of the applicable fee for any
                Services (each, a “Service Subscription Fee”) at the time you create your Account and select your
                package (each, a “Service Commencement Date”).  Except as set forth in the Terms, all fees for the
                Services are non-refundable.  No contract will exist between you and the Company for the Services until
                the Company accepts your order by a confirmatory e-mail, SMS/MMS message, or other appropriate means of
                communication.
                <br/>
                9.3 Multiple Job Listing Fee.  Users may post one job opening per listing. In the event you post more
                than one job opening per listing (each, an “Additional Job Opening”), the Company will send an e-mail to
                the last e-mail address you provided to with your Account.  In the event you do not remove the
                additional job openings from your listing within 48 hours of the Company’s notice, you will be charged
                an additional job opening fee for each Additional Job Opening listed in your job listing. You are solely
                responsible for updating the e-mail address(es) associated with your Account.
                <br/>
                9.4 Taxes.  The Company’s fees are net of any applicable Sales Tax.  If any Services, or payments for
                any Services, under the Terms are subject to Sales Tax in any jurisdiction and you have not remitted the
                applicable Sales Tax to the Company, you will be responsible for the payment of such Sales Tax and any
                related penalties or interest to the relevant tax authority, and you will indemnify the Company for any
                liability or expense we may incur in connection with such Sales Taxes. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Upon our request, you will provide us with official receipts issued by the appropriate taxing authority,
                or other such evidence that you have paid all applicable taxes.  For purposes of this section, “Sales
                Tax” shall mean any sales or use tax, and any other tax measured by sales proceeds, that the Company is
                permitted to pass to its customers, that is the functional equivalent of a sales tax where the
                applicable taxing jurisdiction does not otherwise impose a sales or use tax.
                <br/>
                Indemnification
                <br/>
                You agree to indemnify and hold the Company, its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, employees,
                agents, partners and licensors (collectively, the “Company Parties”) harmless from any losses, costs,
                liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) relating to or arising out of: (a) Your
                Content; (b) your use of, or inability to use, the Company Properties, including, but not limited to,
                Referral Programs; (c) your violation of the Terms; (d) your violation of any rights of another party,
                including any Users; or (e)your violation of any applicable laws, rules or regulations.  
                <br/>
                The Company reserves the right, at its own cost, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any
                matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will fully cooperate with the
                Company in asserting any available defenses.  You agree that the provisions in this section will survive
                any termination of your Account, the Terms or your access to the Company Properties.
                <br/>

                PERIOD DURING WHICH YOU FIRST ASSERT A CLAIM.  IF YOU HAVE NOT PAID THE COMPANY ANY AMOUNTS IN THE

                SHALL BE LIMITED TO FIFTY DOLLARS ($50).

                12.3 User Content.  THE COMPANY PARTIES ASSUME NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE TIMELINESS, DELETION,
                MIS-DELIVERY OR FAILURE TO STORE ANY CONTENT (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, YOUR CONTENT AND USER

            </p>
            <p>
                Term
                <br/>
                The Terms commence on the date when you accept them (as described in the preamble above) and remain in
                full force and effect while you use the Company Properties, unless terminated earlier in accordance with
                the Terms.
                <br/>
                13.1 Prior Use.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you used the Company Properties prior to the date you
                accepted the Terms, you hereby acknowledge and agree that the Terms commenced on the date you first used
                the Company Properties (whichever is earlier) and will remain in full force and effect while you use the
                Company Properties, unless earlier terminated in accordance with the Terms.
                <br/>
                13.2 Termination of Services by Company.  You will have thirty (30) days from the Service Commencement
                Date, or any Renewal Commencement Date, for any Services hereunder, to cancel such Service, in which
                case the Company will refund your Service Subscription Fee, if already paid pursuant to Section 9.2 or
                9.3, for the applicable Service.
                <br/>
                Except as set forth above, the Service Subscription Fee for any Service shall be non-refundable.  If
                timely payment cannot be charged to your Payment Provider for any reason, if you have materially
                breached any provision of the Terms, or if the Company is required to do so by law (e.g., where the
                provision of the Website, the Application, the Software or the Services is, or becomes, unlawful), the
                Company has the right to, immediately and without notice, suspend or terminate any Services provided to
                you. You agree that all terminations for cause shall be made in the Company’s sole discretion and that
                the Company shall not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your Account.
                <br/>
                13.3 Termination of Services by You.  If you want to terminate the Services provided by the Company, you
                may do so by (a) notifying the Company at any time and (b) closing your Account for all of the Services
                that you use. Your notice should be sent, in writing, to the Company’s address set forth below.
                <br/>
                13.4 Effect of Termination.  Termination of any Service includes removal of access to such Service and
                barring of further use of the Service. Termination  of  all Services also includes deletion of your
                password and all related information, files and Content associated with or inside your Account (or any
                part thereof), including Your Content.  Upon termination of any Service, your right to use such Service
                will automatically terminate immediately. You understand that any termination of Services may involve
                deletion of Your Content associated therewith from our live databases.  The Company will not have any
                liability whatsoever to you for any suspension or termination, including for deletion of Your Content.
                <br/>
                 All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive, shall survive termination of
                Services, including without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, and limitation of
                liability.
            </p>
            <p>
                Remedies
                <br/>
                14.1 Violations.  If the Company becomes aware of any possible violations by you of the Terms, the
                Company reserves the right to investigate such violations.  If, as a result of the investigation, the
                Company believes that criminal activity has occurred, the Company reserves the right to refer the matter
                to, and to cooperate with any and all applicable legal authorities.  
                <br/>
                The Company is entitled, except to the extent prohibited by applicable law, to disclose any information
                or materials on or in the Company Properties, including Your Content, in the Company’s possession in
                connection with your use of the Company Properties to:
                <br/>

                enforcement or other government officials, as the Company in its sole discretion believes to be
                necessary or appropriate.
                <br/>
                14.2 Breach.  In the event that the Company determines, in its sole discretion, that you have breached
                any portion of the Terms, or have otherwise demonstrated conduct inappropriate for the Company
                Properties, the Company reserves the right to:
                <br/>
                (1) Warn you via e-mail (to any e-mail address you have provided to the Company) that you have violated
                the Terms;
                <br/>
                (2) Delete any of Your Content provided by you or your agent(s) to the Company Properties;
                <br/>

                <br/>
                (5) Notify and/or send Content to and/or fully cooperate with the proper law enforcement authorities for
                further action; and/or
                <br/>
                (6) Pursue any other action which the Company deems to be appropriate.
                <br/>
                14.3 No Subsequent Registration.  If your registration(s) with or ability to access the Company
                Properties, or any other Company community is discontinued by the Company due to your violation of any
                portion of the Terms or for conduct otherwise inappropriate for the community, then you agree that you
                shall not attempt to re-register with or access the Company Properties or any Company community through
                use of a different member name or otherwise, and you acknowledge that you will not be entitled to
                receive a refund for fees related to those Company Properties to which your access has been terminated.
                 
                <br/>
                In the event that you violate the immediately preceding sentence, the Company reserves the right, in its
                sole discretion, to immediately take any or all of the actions set forth herein without any notice or
                warning to you.

                General
                <br/>
                16.1 Dispute Resolution. Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully.  It is part of your contract
                with Company and affects your rights.  It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A
                CLASS ACTION WAIVER.
                <br/>
                (a) Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.  All claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or
                other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with the Terms or the use of any product or
                service provided by the Company that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be
                resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement.
                 Unless otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings shall be held in English.
                This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and the Company, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents,
                employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized
                users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms.
                <br/>
                (b) Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution.  Before either party may seek arbitration, the
                party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”) describing the nature
                and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief.  A Notice to the Company should be sent to:
                1504 summer creek dr. unit a
                Austin, TX 78704
                  After the Notice is received, you and the Company may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute
                informally.  If you and the Company do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after
                the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding.  The amount of any settlement
                offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined
                the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is entitled.
                <br/>
                (c) Arbitration Rules.  Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association
                (“AAA”), an established alternative dispute resolution provider (“ADR Provider”) that offers arbitration
                as set forth in this section.  If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select
                an alternative ADR Provider.
                The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration, including but not limited to
                the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict
                with the Terms.  The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (“Arbitration Rules”) governing the arbitration are
                available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.  
                The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator.  Any claims or disputes where the
                total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved
                through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief.  For claims
                or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or
                more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules.  
                Any hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of
                the United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise.  If you reside outside of the U.S., the
                arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings.
                Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent
                jurisdiction.  If the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than the last settlement offer that
                the Company made to you prior to the initiation of arbitration, the Company will pay you the greater of
                the award or $2,500.00.  Each party shall bear its own costs (including attorney’s fees) and
                disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the
                ADR Provider.
                <br/>
                (d) Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration.  If non-appearance-based arbitration is
                elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written
                submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration.  The
                arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise
                agreed by the parties.
                <br/>
                (e) Time Limits.  If you or the Company pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated
                and/or demanded within the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and
                within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.
                <br/>
                (f) Authority of Arbitrator.  If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and
                liabilities, if any, of you and the Company, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other
                matters or joined with any other cases or parties.  The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant
                motions dispositive of all or part of any claim.  The arbitrator shall have the authority to award
                monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under
                applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms.  The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement
                of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the
                calculation of any damages awarded.  The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an
                individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.  The award of the arbitrator is final and
                binding upon you and the Company.
                <br/>
                (g) Waiver of Jury Trial.  THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO
                COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes
                shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement.  Arbitration procedures are typically
                more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very
                limited review by a court.  In the event any litigation should arise between you and the Company in any
                state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND THE
                COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.
                <br/>
                (h) Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.  ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS
                ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS,
                AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED
                WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.  
                <br/>
                (i) Confidentiality.  All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award
                of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential.  The parties agree to
                maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law.  This paragraph shall not prevent a party
                from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an
                arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.
                <br/>
                (j) Severability.  If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be
                invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be
                of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full
                force and effect.
                <br/>
                (k) Right to Waive.  Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement
                may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted.  Such waiver shall not waive or affect
                any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.
                <br/>
                (l) Survival of Agreement.  This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship
                with Company.  
                <br/>
                (m) Small Claims Court.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or the Company may bring an
                individual action in small claims court.
                <br/>
                (n) Emergency Equitable Relief.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek emergency
                equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending
                arbitration.  A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or
                obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.
