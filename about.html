  <h6>The story behind our logo, the Pineapple:</h6>
  <p>
    Any guest who was invited to a party where a whole pineapple was displayed, knew that no expense was spared in guaranteeing the guests' enjoyment. It was this that made the crowned fruit the high symbol of social events and became the meaning of welcome, friendship, and hospitality.
