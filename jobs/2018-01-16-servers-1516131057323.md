I am in need of PT servers. Weekend availability mandatory. 5.00hr + tips, no experience necessary, great place for weekend job open until 1am Mondays Fridays and Saturdays close at 12am every other night.  Open 10am on Saturdays and 11am every other day.  Open interviews on Tuesdays and Thursdays between 4pm and 6pm. If bartending is what you want,  I try to always promote servers before hiring outside company.
