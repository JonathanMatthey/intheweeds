Third Base Northwest is a locally owned Austin based sports bar. We have 3 locations in the Austin area! Full menu is available 11am-12pm with the exception of Friday and Saturdays-1am. With Spring in full swing and our great covered patio, we are looking for part time and/or full time hard-working servers. Apply online or in person.
