The County Line is an Austin barbecue legend that has been serving their special brand since 1975.

Whether it's On the Hill or On the Lake, there's no doubt that The County Line is not only an Austin barbecue destination -- it's a Texas barbecue destination. With a rich history (and an even richer, smoked brisket!), the County Line is the stuff of legend -- barbecue and otherwise -- that is so good, you'll want to "Get It All Over Ya!"

Founded in 1975, The County Line's barbecue philosophy has just four principles: serve the highest quality smoked barbecue -- ribs, brisket, sausage and chicken -- with traditional sides of cole slaw, potato salad and beans; offer generous portions at reasonable prices; hire happy staff and offer friendly table service with linens and bar service; and serve it all in an authentic location that celebrates the heritage of Texas.

County Line on the Lake is looking for dedicated, self-motivated workers for Front of the House positions. We have always been known for our stellar service and we want to add your smiling face to our team! The secret to becoming a legendary barbecue destination is our service staff providing the best dining experience in a Real Texas BBQ smokehouse.

Come and join the crew out here and put some green in your pocket! It's a great place to work for students and others looking for flexible schedules. Most of our employees have been here for years and come back during the holidays to pick up shifts. Plus, all employees (AND THEIR FAMILIES) get a 50% discount at ALL County Line locations! Come by between 2pm and 4pm Monday through Saturday to fill out an application and speak to a manager. You can also give us a call at (512)346-3664 and ask for G.W...See you soon!
