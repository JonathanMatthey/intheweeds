Seeking a seasoned, dedicated server with at least 3 years of serving experience and thorough food and wine knowledge. Must be able to handle high-volume service and wear many hats throughout each shift (server, busser, food runner, host). Currently hiring for 3-4 dinner shifts and 2-3 lunch shifts Monday-Saturday (closed Sunday); however an open schedule is preferred.

La Traviata is a locally and family owned Italian restaurant in the heart of downtown Austin. We have a small, tight-knit staff that prides itself on working as a team to give superior service. Only applicants serious about joining our family need apply.
