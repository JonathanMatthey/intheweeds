Server's Assistant/Expo positions are responsible for running food primarily. Ensuring food leaving the window has everything necessary before reaching the customer's tables. Additional responsibilities include assisting in setting up the restaurant before we open, making sure there's a smooth shift change, and assisting in closing the restaurant. Pre-bussing and resetting tables, cutting fruit, making tea and taking out trash are also but not limited to additional responsibilities.
