All Trudy's locations are hiring! At the north location, all front of house positions are available. You can apply online at www.trudys.com and if you put me (Karleigh Garza) as a reference, we will both get a couple hundred bucks if you stay for six months! There are tons of other perks, like bonuses for employee of the week and month and for being the best new server. Every month there are four sales contests, each one you win earns you $250!
