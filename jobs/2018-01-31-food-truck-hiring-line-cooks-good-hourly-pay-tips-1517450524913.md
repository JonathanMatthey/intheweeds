We're a fun small group of tight knit people running a really fun business.  We like to have fun, work hard and keep our employees happy and valued.  Our truck is setting up on the patio as a main stay at a popular bar on the East Side of downtown Austin starting Feb 15th, 2018.  I'm looking to hire one or two more people that can be jacks/janes of all trades.  Busy nights may have multiple people staffed, but slower nights you'll be running solo.  So being able to multi-task is a must. You'll be line cook, cashier etc.
