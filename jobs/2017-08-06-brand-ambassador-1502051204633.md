I'm looking for about 5 dedicated ladies or guys to add to my brand ambassador team at Treaty Oak. Must be available to work Fridays 5-8pm and varying shifts on Saturday (although shifts typically are only 3 hours) plus occasional shifts on weekday evenings for pint nights.

Shifts will be primarily at liquor stores sampling customers on our spirits and selling bottles.
Week day shifts will be at pint nights, where you will buy customer Treaty Oak Brew, inform them of the product and represent the brand in a positive way.
