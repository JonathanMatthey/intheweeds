We are looking for a full time (or 2 part time) hosts.  
The host must be hard working, punctual & have a great attitude!
 We make authentic Indian food from scratch and are willing to train those willing to do all needed tasks big and small with an open mind and great attitude for learning.


Please check out our website www.grajmahalaustin.com or our interview on Food Networkâ€™s Eat Street


Hosts- As the face of our restaurant, we require our hosts to greet every guest as they enter, and invite them back as they leave. A positive attitude, great smile, and adaptability are essential to this role. Also it should be noted that we are a high volume restaurant on a street of bars... thick skin and a great attitude is absolutely necessary for this position.
