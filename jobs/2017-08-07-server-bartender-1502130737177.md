  We are a casual sports bar with a great atmosphere and great clientele to go
  with it! Football season is the highest volume for our business. We just
  picked up one of Austin's largest college football watch parties. Ohio State,
  will have 2 locations because of the number of alumni living in Austin and we
  are the north location. Projected to have 300 alumni for their first game
  8/31!  Will also be needing extra staff for Mayweather/ McGregor fight. We
  will be blocking off our parking lot with 2 projector screens with full audio
  throughout the restaurant and parking lot. This will be the biggest event in
  boxing to date!

Third Base is Austin's prime sports viewing restaurant with 3 locations ranging from North Austin to South Austin. We are looking for top notch customer service to help with what is projected to be our busiest year for football we have had.
