Tillery is a new East Austin casual fine dining restaurant. We are located in a beautiful space with the river right in our backyard! Our menu features Mediterranean inspired, locally sourced, shareable plates and hand crafted cocktails.

We are currently looking for full-time FOH candidates who are passionate about food and service. We are low drama and very team oriented.

** We pride ourselves in cross-training in different departments and promoting from within! **

If you take pride in your work environment, are dedicated to providing excellent service, and excited about a local, seasonal menu this could be the right fit for you!
