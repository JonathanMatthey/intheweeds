Crew members get to learn about and work at a variety of positions:
* Food Runner/Busser
* Cashier
* Expo
* Kitchen including prep, wok cook, fry cook

In each area they're greeting and interacting with Fire Bowl's customers directly. Crew members' responsibilities require them to be on their feet working while clocked in, unless on break. If they are not busy, they are expected to take on tasks they see that need to get done, and pitch in to help their teammates.
