I'm looking for at least 1 full time line/fry cook over at fat Sal's deli on Guadalupe st, we also have a food truck on Rainey, after you're trained will be able to pick up shifts there as well. We start at $10/hr + tips, with a review and opportunity for more after 90 days.  Please be professional, courteous, and clean. This is not a stress filled kitchen and it's an easy and fun menu.  Shift meals included
