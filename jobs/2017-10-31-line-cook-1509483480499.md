About Sifted 
The modern tech office is innovative, lean + environmentally conscious. Typical corporate catering is not. Sifted set out to reimagine the office lunch hour, creating a data-driven experience that's designed for destination workplaces. Today, Sifted creates experiential lunch programs for high-growth, culture-centric companies.

Brands who want to treat their staff to chef-made, hand-delivered lunches hire Sifted to provide a daily or weekly lunch in their office. The service is fully-managed and laced with incredible attention to detail. From our professional hosts + account managers to our kitchen ninjas who take care of all dietary needs, Sifted's lunch programs feel like a perk for everyone in the office. 

We have a reputation of feeding software engineers + fast growing teams better than anyone (if you have a team of your own, you know that's a skill). We're partners in helping colossal companies stay tight-knit and startups harness their natural energy.
