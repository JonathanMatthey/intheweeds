This posting is for 2 different positions we are currently hiring for.

Fun cafe in downtown Austin

The first is a full time position for a morning barista/counter person Mon-Fri no weekends! The shift starts at 6:30am-2ish
This position requires someone that is very reliable and has some barista experience. You will be using a cash register, making coffee beverages occasionally and helping run food. We rotate who does what, so it won't be just one or the other everyday.

The 2nd position is for a delivery person from 11am-2pm then switch over to counter/bar service till about 6pm also no weekends!. The delivery radius is all walking distance around the cafe downtown, most are only a few blocks or less.
