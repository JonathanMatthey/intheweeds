Growing popular pizza trailer needs a part-time cook. 2 shifts (usually 4pm-midnight) per week to start, about 16-20hrs/week (full-time hours very possible/likely in a couple months). We make almost everything from scratch (dough, sauce, pickled jalape√±os, "beeteroni", and other toppings), so previous line/prep cook experience and knife skills are a must (pizza experience not necessary). We're a trailer, so you'll also have to be comfortable talking to customers, taking orders/payments (Toast POS), lifting heavy stuff, washing dishes, and other cleaning. We're woman, queer and POC friendly, and don't tolerate any harrassment or bigotry.
