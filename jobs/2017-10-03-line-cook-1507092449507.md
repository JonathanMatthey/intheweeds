I am looking for a cook with solid knife skills and the ability to work any station required. It's a small line needing only two to three people to run it. Banquet experience would also be a big plus. We frequently execute weddings and parties. Infrequent late night is a major plus. Just looking for someone who is motivated, dependable, and takes pride in their work.
