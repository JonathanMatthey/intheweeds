Hello! My name is Aaron and I'm the Kitchen Manager at The Brass Tap in Round Rock. We're currently looking for part-full time kitchen staff 4-5 days/week. It's a cool environment with fun people and you get to work in an awesome craft beer bar! It's hourly pay plus daily tips, you get a shift meal while you're here, plus employee discounts. We have a very basic kitchen setup with no intense cooking and mainly build-to-order type dishes. It is bar food after all. As far as kitchen work goes, this is an easy gig. Even if you're only looking for part-time, we can try and make it work, so don't hesitate to reach out!
