Hello we have a full-time morning barista/counter service position available. It's Mon-Fri 6:30am-2ish no weekends!!
 Being more of a "Morning Person" would be a great fit for this position. We need someone reliable as you would be opening up the shop with one other person. 
We're a fun cafe downtown with a good group of people employed.
