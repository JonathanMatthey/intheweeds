The Hideout Pub is looking to add a member to the family that's experienced in the BOH. Full time or part time available. Full time positions come with full health benefits. A fast paced small location, where we are a tight knit group of laid back, hard working people! Also shoot me an email if you have any questions about what we have to offer.
