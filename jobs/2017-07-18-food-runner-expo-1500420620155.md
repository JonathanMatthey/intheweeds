Fast-paced downtown bar/restaurant is looking for an energetic, detail oriented individual to join our team. Ideally you would have previous BOH experience as a food runner, expo or even cook- though previous experience is not required it can be helpful. We also love to promote from within so if you’re looking to get your foot in the door in bar/ restaurant world this a good opportunity to do so.
