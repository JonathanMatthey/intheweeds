I know this isn't the traditional "service industry" job but the skills we're looking for are similar to what makes someone successful as a part of the FOH team. 

Tried & True Barber & Tattoo is hiring for our front desk. This is an important position that keeps the shop running smoothly, supports the barbers and tattoo artists and most importantly makes sure the customers are happy.

Our reception is the first person that customers interact with so we’re looking for someone who's fun, a hard worker and smiles even under pressure. This is a part time position with about 20 hours a week. We offer a good hourly rate, a fun work environment, free haircuts and if you’re nice to the artists there might be some tattoos in it for you too.
