description: "Curbside Coffee is looking for experienced baristas and coffee enthusiasts to join our home-grown effort to bring natural, handmade products to our local community!\r\n\r\nWho we are….\r\n\r\nCurbside Coffee is a busy, Italian-style espresso bar and cafe, dedicated to changing our food and beverage culture for the better. We serve Cuvee coffee, organic milks, scratch-made pastries, sandwiches made on house-baked bread and pizzas crafted with ingredients prepared fresh in our kitchen.  \r\n\r\nWe are locally owned in Taylor, Texas---a booming little town just east of Round Rock---home of Louie Mueller BBQ (named “the epitome of Texas barbecue by the NYT) and SST Records.\r\n\r\nOnce a thriving cotton town and railroad depot, Taylor’s historic entertainment district, The Line, was a mecca for touring R&B artists in the 50s and 60s. Sadly, The Line no longer exists, but its spirit has been revived in recent years by Black Sparrow Music Parlor and Taylor Station---listening rooms dedicated to the integrity of recording art and performance. Our mainstreet has been reinvigorated by community-minded creatives and small business owners, eager to put our town back on the map as a hub of culture and entrepreneurial energy. We cut the ribbon on our new skate park this summer---a project imagined by local teenagers and funded in part by pro-skateboarder, Tony Hawk. \r\n\r\nCurbside Coffee and our sister businesses, 2nd Street Farm-2-Market and 2nd Street Commercial Kitchen, is a young but rapidly growing family of businesses. This is a great opportunity for those interested in cooperative business management, Main Street development initiatives, or young chefs looking to make a difference."
qualifications: "Who you are….\r\n\r\nWe are hiring professional baristas, espresso aficionados, or customer service whiz kids who are curious about what makes great coffee! \r\n\r\nMust have excellent customer service instincts, positive spirit, great communication skills (with teammates, customers and management) and most importantly---an enthusiasm for our mission. \r\n\r\nCoffee shop experience strongly preferred, but we will gladly train newbies if you possess all of the above requirements.\r\n\r\nFull-time and part-time positions available. Must work one weekend day to start.\r\n\r\nMust be eligible to work in the US, certified as a Texas Food Handler and have reliable transportation."
