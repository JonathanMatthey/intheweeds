Thanks for the add. I am the GM of Dance Across Texas @ 2201 E.Ben White here in South Austin.

I have a solid crew of high volume bartenders but am looking to add one or possibly two strong, high volume bartenders who are TABC certified.

I also need waitresses who know how to get in the mix and make money for themselves and my club.

I have no problem giving folks time off when they need and I am empathetic to the fact that things happen in our lives that cause us to miss work. Having said that if you have a litany of ready made excuses of why you cannot do your job, Iâ€™m not the guy you want to work for. In short, no drama kings or queens need apply.

Come by the club Thursday through Saturday 8pm through 2 Am and ask for Shane. You may also call 512-910-4000 to make an appointment. Thanks and we are extremely Veteran friendly.
