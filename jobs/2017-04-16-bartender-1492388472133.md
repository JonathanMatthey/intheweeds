We're a steady neighborhood bar looking for another bartender that will represent us well & be a part of our fun crew. We have 4 to 5 shifts available for the right person. Our bartenders work hard and earn the money to match their efforts so we're looking for the perfect fit.  

This is the kind of person we're looking for:
+2 years bartending experience (not festival lines or restaurants, actual bars)
+Great attitude & friendliness that creates more regulars
+Basic cocktail knowledge (we do a little muddling & shaking from time to time but nothing too fancy)
+Able to work shifts alone & balance customers with dishes, bussing, & changing kegs as needed
+Can work quickly taking multiple orders when busy
+Someone flexible & able to pick up shifts when needed


What we're not looking for:
-Clock punchers who don't enjoy working in a bar
-People who can't stay sober at work
-People who have been "fired for no reason" at another job (there's always a reason, you just didn't figure it out)
-People with 5 jobs already
-Bores

Send your resume and a link to your Facebook page because we may already know each other.
