Our projects include include South Congress Hotel, Hotel Ella, La Condesa, Sway, Central Standard, Café No Sé, Mañana, Goodall's Kitchen, Pao and the forthcoming Il Brutto, Le Politique and Sway Westlake and Sway Domain.

A traditional brasserie, Le Politique will offer a menu of classic French fare, including trout amandine, escargot, tarte flambée and an extensive raw bar of oysters, clams and lobster. An adjoining patisserie and coffee shop will feature a selection of housemade pastries and perfectly pulled espresso to-go.
