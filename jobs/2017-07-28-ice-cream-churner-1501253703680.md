We're Lick Honest Ice Creams and we're looking for somebody who loves ice cream almost as much as we do. We're rapidly expanding our business and are always looking for more good food-obsessed people to join our kitchen family!

Some of your duties will include assisting our team in assembling and cutting ice cream sandwiches, helping to maintain a healthy clean kitchen and washing/ prepping fresh fruit for sauces. Your main responsibility will be churning and hand-packing pints of ice cream. It's probably something you've never done before. It's probably going to be a challenge. So if you're up for a challenge, if you're self-motivated, if you take great pride in your work, if you enjoy seeing your own handmade product across the state, If you love working with a team and if you really like eating ice cream (which you'll be required to do), then we encourage you to apply.

Immediate positions available for full-time and part-time.


You must have great, legitimate professional references and reliable transportation.

You must be able to lift 50 pounds.

You will be required to have a Food Handler certificate or obtain one within 30 days of hire for this position.
