Gourmands Neighborhood Pub is looking for two opening cooks with at least 2 years experience in the kitchen. Mon-Fri 7a-3p and Sat-Tue 7a-5p. These positions are high volume and our kitchen is open to the establishment. We are looking for people who value presentation, can talk with customers, and are reliable and punctual. Our cooks do everything in the kitchen from prep, dishes, cook recipes, and work the line. Our kitchen closes at midnight daily.

Thank you and we look forward to having you as a part of our team!
