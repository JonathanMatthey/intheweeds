Modern Market Eatery is Hiring for several positions.  (Dish, Prep, Line, Cashier)  We cook using simple, whole ingredients purchased from farmers, ranchers and suppliers we know and trust; who love and respect the planet as much as we do.

Weâ€™re a place where paleo, vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free and 'non dieting' friends can all enjoy a great meal, together. Good, clean food works for everyone, and so, we are trying to bring it everywhere.

AM and PM shifts available.  Full or Part time.
