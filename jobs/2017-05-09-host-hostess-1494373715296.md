The importance of a host at Ernie's cannot be overstated! Most of the time are the first and last team member our guest will see, and thus, making your role crucial when it comes to us providing a memorable experience that our guests have come to expect. We are a destination restaurant/bar and it's time to gear up for peak season which runs thru September.
