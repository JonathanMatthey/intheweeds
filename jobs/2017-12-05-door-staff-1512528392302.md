6th Street staple seeking energetic, hardworking individuals to join our door staff! We are an Independently run, high volume bar, known for awesome food and giant eye-catching drinks. Most importantly, we have a loyal following and an established brand.

Although we are not a corporate establishment we do expect a lot from our employees. You should be extremely outgoing and friendly. You should be confident in your ability to create regulars and enjoy interacting with a wide range of people.  You should thrive in a fast paced environment and enjoy working as a part of a team. You should take pride in your appearance as you are the first person people see when entering the bar. Previous experience is a plus, but we are willing to train the right person for the job.
