  Prefer at least 2 years experience serving. Familiar with Aloha and tequila a
  plus but not necessary. Need to know how to run your section like a boss,
  multitasking a must. Qualified candidates can earn premium $$ but you have to
  prove you know what you're doing and that you've got what it takes, simple
  enough right? Looking for both part time and full time candidates. Also
  looking to hire hosts, if you don't have the experience but think you've got
  what it takes starting there is a good way to break in.

Brunch on the weekends features a live DJ, noted in DO512 on numerous occasions, and caterings for local events and businesses.
