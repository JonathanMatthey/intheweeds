description: "At Alamo Drafthouse, our passion is to ensure every GUEST has an AWESOME experience and is EXCITED to come back. Our servers help to create an extraordinary journey for our guest by attending to their needs and suggesting mouth-watering food and fun-to-drink beverage options to pair with the movie experience. From the initial greet, our server builds a rapport with each guest and personally takes charge of ensuring that they enjoyed their stay with us.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo be a member of our server team; you are focused on setting the stage for our guests by welcoming everyone and wowing them with your dedication to provide exceptional customer service while helping us preserve a distraction-free movie-watching environment. During and between shows, the team maintains a clean theater environment. Our server team members are always cool under pressure and take ownership of ensuring a guest never leaves upset. While no two days are alike and we may get really busy; we are a group of people who promote teamwork, encourage a fun work environment, and share common goals of creating memorable experiences for our guests.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPicture yourself as a Server where you would have the opportunity to:                           \r\n\r\n-Work with a smile. The vibe you set could make or break the guest experience.\r\n-Move like a ninja. Help our guests enjoy the movie after the show begins by stealthily moving around the darkened theater taking orders - you are a silent warrior.\r\n-Be Prepared. This requires you to come ready to work and have a thorough knowledge of our food/drink menu so that you can answer our guests’ questions. While serving our guests, you are a master at managing time so that orders arrive promptly, payments are taken without distraction and can be settled prior to the show ending.\r\n-Ensure the theater is safe. Checking IDs and cutting people off is not the most fun parts of the job, but they are important. If a guest becomes disruptive, inform a manager and the situation will be taken care of.\r\n-Work with a team. A clean house is a welcoming place and we want our guests to feel at home while visiting our theater. You’ll be responsible for preparing the theaters for guests, cleaning, and keeping the service areas organized."
