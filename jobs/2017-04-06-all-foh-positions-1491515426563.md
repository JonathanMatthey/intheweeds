A true Texas original story complete with secret recipe; a chicken restaurant with a whole lot of history. We are in a brand new building in the Mueller District and looking to staff up!

Our service style is a hybrid (similar to Hopdoddy). We are counter service, but also have servers on the floor to push up-selling of our Beer, Wine and Cocktails on tap as well as pie or milkshakes. That being said, FOH employees make $7.25 plus tips.

Currently we are only open lunches from 11-2 pm, but after the end of April, we will be open from 11-11 everyday. We are looking for full-time and part-time employees both lunch and dinner shifts. 

If you would like to apply, email Stephen at stephen.roberts@jtyoungbloods.com. We would love to have you come in for an interview.
