We're a great group of 3 owners who work in the trenches with our staff.  We'll be running a food truck on the east side serving a unique menu of street food focused on skewers.  The menu will run special as well so you'll have a chance to be creative if you'd like.   We'll be open 7 days a week, so they'll be work available to staff every day.  Hours will be either 3-9 or 8-close if we end up at the bar that we're talking with.  Otherwise we'll be at a food truck park on E 6th and the hours will be midday and late night.
