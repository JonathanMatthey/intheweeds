description: "2nd Street Farm-2-Market is looking for customer service pros and farm-to-table enthusiasts to support our passionate counter service team during our increasingly busy lunch rushes!\r\n\r\nWho we are….\r\n\r\n2nd Street Farm-2-Market is a neighborhood grocery and deli, offering healthy, handmade prepared foods alongside a seasonal selection of locally grown produce and regional, organic and/or gluten free grocery products. \r\n\r\nWe are locally owned in Taylor, Texas---a booming little town just east of Round Rock---home of Louie Mueller BBQ (named “the epitome of Texas barbecue by the NYT) and SST Records.\r\n\r\nOnce a thriving cotton town and railroad depot, Taylor’s historic entertainment district, The Line, was a mecca for touring R&B artists in the 50s and 60s. Sadly, The Line no longer exists, but its spirit has been revived in recent years by Black Sparrow Music Parlor and Taylor Station---listening rooms dedicated to the integrity of recording art and performance. Our mainstreet has been reinvigorated by community-minded creatives and small business owners, eager to put our town back on the map as a hub of culture and entrepreneurial energy. This summer, we cut the ribbon on our new skate park, funded in part by pro-skateboarder, Tony Hawk. \r\n\r\n2nd Street Farm-2-Market and our sister enterprises, Curbside Coffee and 2nd Street Commercial Kitchen, is a young but rapidly growing family of businesses. This is a great opportunity for those interested in cooperative business management, Main Street development initiatives, or young chefs looking to make a difference."
