We are a locally owned high volume bar/restaurant in the heart of downtown. This job is perfect for someone wanting to break into the service industry but with little to no experience. We also have flexible hours so if you’re in school that’s not a problem. General duties include greeting all guests, seating parties and keeping up with the waitlist, and some light side work such as rolling silverware.
