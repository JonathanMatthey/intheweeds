Roppolo's Pizzeria is on the lookout for prompt, dependable, hardworking and FUN people interested in a part time, late night job. START TRAINING IMMEDIATELY!!!

These are part time positions...weekends must be open and flexible...meaning you will usually be scheduled two or three shifts a week and will be expected to work until 3:30 am or a bit later. (we do have a schedule request book, so don't let that scare you).

CASHIER positions are available giving you an opportunity to work in a fast paced environment in the entertainment district where you never know who you will be preparing pizza for...get ready to crank out some of the best pizza in Texas!!! You could be working in one of our brick and mortars or one of our mobile trailers around downtown.

Interested candidates should reply to the email address above. In your email please give me your name, phone number, and a copy of your resume. If you do not have a resume prepared, no problem! Just list the places you have worked and for how long and give me 2 references I can contact. I will set up interviews via email so please, reply to this ad instead of coming in to the store and filling out an application. 

I look forward to hearing from you!
