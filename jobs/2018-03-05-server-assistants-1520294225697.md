Juniper, one of Austin's most exciting fine dining restaurants, is looking to add some new members to our Front of House team. Recently listed in the top 10 best restaurants in the city by the Statesman, Juniper produces locally sourced, hyper-seasonal Texas fare as seen through the lens of traditional Northern Italian cuisine. Rounding out our offerings are a world-class beverage program, and a variety of special culinary events, pop-ups, and other collaborations throughout the year. 

We are looking for people that fit the following: - Team-oriented - Eager to learn - Self-starter - Hustle & follow-through - A genuine passion for making people happy We believe that true hospitality starts with treating your employees well, creating a culture that puts our employees first so that, in turn, they can share that culture of positivity with our guests. We promise to continue to invest in our team in training, education, and otherwise, and we are committed to making this the best restaurant to work for in the city.

Sunday availability required.
