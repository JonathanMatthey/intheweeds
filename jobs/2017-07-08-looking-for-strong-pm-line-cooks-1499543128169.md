It's time! Holy Roller, a new restaurant and bar off of West 6th Street is looking for experienced team members that want to join us in opening a pretty damn fun concept in a very VERY busy part of town. Holy Roller aims to be a little something for everyone - bar, restaurant, take out counter, coffee, pastries...

We bake/make everything from scratch in-house daily!

Come be a part of our family!
