Tired of cooking someone else's food? Why feed their ego when you can nourish yours? Our cooks create their own menus...every shift, every station, every day. They have been doing so for 16 years.
Think about having the opportunity to fully develop YOUR approach to food. Now, we know your cooking will be good on day 15, but how good will it be on day 415? Ready to find out? Give yourself a real chance to take the next step, at the restaurant that started it all.
Our pay is competitive, based on experience and performance during the first 6 weeks. Our turnover is very low because we hire good people and then get out of their way. We are a tight knit, familial group - restaurant professionals who have proudly chosen this life. We are not waiting for the band to get back together. Send me your resume at the email provided and let's talk.
