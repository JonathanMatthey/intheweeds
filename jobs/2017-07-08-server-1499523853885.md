Hey hey! The Grove in Lakeway is now hiring experienced servers. We are great place with fresh food, loyal clientele, and a fantastic view! We run 5-8 table sections and give you opportunity to really sell.  Wine chops are preferred but not mandatory as we are willing to teach. We're looking for line cooks and dishwashers, too!
