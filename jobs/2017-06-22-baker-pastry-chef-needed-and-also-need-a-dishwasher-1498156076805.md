We're a busy Cafe Downtown that has an immediate opening for a baker/pastry chef.
Knowledge of bread is a must. We have several standards that will stick with both breads and desserts but finding someone that would want to be creative as well would be great. The hours will probably range from about 30 a week and up, which will be about 5pm until 11pm or so. Depending on how we work things out it could be Mon-Fri or Sun-Thurs. 

We also need a full time dishwasher/prep Mon-Fri 10am-6pm

Please send resume/cover letter so that we can potentially set up an interview.
