TNT/Tacos and Tequila is a Southwestern Grill and Tequila Bar. TNT offers great grilled products prepared to order to the customer’s liking.  Guacamole is made fresh at the table from a rolling Guacamole Cart. ‘Fresh’, ‘handmade’, ‘simple’, ‘local’ are words used to describe TNT food. Quality is also the cornerstone of the Tequila Bar. Limes, lemons and oranges are hand-squeezed to give the freshest and most authentic taste to the margaritas and craft cocktails made with one of 100 premium tequilas and organic agave nectar.
