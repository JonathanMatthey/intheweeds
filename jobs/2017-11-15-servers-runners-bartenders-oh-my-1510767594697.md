Looking for some extra holiday cash? 
Want to see all of the holiday movies for free while you're at it? 
Look no further, you've found it.  

We are entering our busy BUSY holiday season and need extra help. 
Runners are responsible for getting food to the auditoriums, dropping it off with guests, and assuring they have what they need. 
Servers take orders, run food/drinks, and make sure the guests have what they need. 
Bartenders work either the front bar and interact with guests or focus on our service bars and make drinks to get them to the auditoriums via servers and runners.  

We have servers selling $2k-$4k per shift on our busiest days.   
Runners are earning $11-$15/hr depending on the day/week. 
Bartenders are clearing $20/hr with ease. 

The best part: we're busy literally every day from now until New Years Day: Justice League, Coco, Star Wars, and no school=TONS of people coming to the movies.
