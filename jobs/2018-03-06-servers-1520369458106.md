We need a couple experienced servers. We are a local company and we treat you like family. This is a place that you will not be micro-managed. Come in, make some money, go home. Schedule is out 2-3 weeks in advance, so you can plan your life. 
If you want a place that you can make money, have a good time, be surrounded by adults, then hit me up!
