We have two kitchens: a sushi bar and traditional kitchen.  This is not a sushi position (although those are available).

We are a busy downtown restaurant that is looking for hard working, dependable people to continue making our establishment successful. Both part time and full time positions are available for line cooks.  We're looking for someone to man the grill / sautee or fryer.

We offer competitive hourly wages and daily shift meals for back of house employees.  Full benefits with health, dental and vision, including 401(k) are available after 90-days of employment for full time employees.
