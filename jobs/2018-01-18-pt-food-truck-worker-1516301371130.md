We’re looking to add a hardworking and fun loving cook to our team. Aside from being an awesome cook you should also be comfortable talking with guests and running food. At the Jackalope South Shore, our cooks run the food to our guests which means more money in your pockets. At this location, the guests order food with the bar staff, and the tickets print up in the food truck (which is located on our giant back patio). You run the food and get tipped out from the bar staff. The better the cook and employee you are, the better the shifts you’re scheduled for.
