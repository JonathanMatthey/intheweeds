As an Associate, you will be the smiling face of Sprinkles as you are the first thing customers see when they walk in our doors. And what's not to smile about at Sprinkles?!

Your job will be to create and maintain the Sprinkles Experience for our customers, that unsurpassed service experience which keeps our regulars standing in line alongside the sightseeing tourists. Red Velvet will become your middle name. You will retain and demonstrate proper policies and procedures delivered by trainers and managers with confidence and enthusiasm. Impeccable customer service and excellent communication skills come hand in hand, so we expect a high quality of verbal and written communication skills for describing our products to writing detailed pre-orders. Teamwork is critical to success in the position, so you will bond with your coworkers over frosting shots and your love of the modern aesthetic in our storefronts.

We are an equal opportunity employer looking for self starters who want to grow with us. We offer a benefits package that includes a competitive salary and bonus, paid vacation, medical coverage, an employer-matched 401(k) plan and more.
