We plan to create a demo website (in the form of an installation profile) of Drupal. Users will be able to try this out when installing Drupal. The main purpose of this demo is to convince technical evaluators that Drupal allows them to build modern and beautiful websites, from conceptions into real life use cases. The demo use case will be a food publishing website. We plan to leave all Drupal-related terminology out of the demo. This is to make sure that there is a separation between the branding of Drupal and demonstrating Drupal. There is no pre-existing designs to leverage. We plan to give the designer carte blanche.
