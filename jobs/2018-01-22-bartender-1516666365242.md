Ah Sing Den is a high-volume craft cocktail bar looking for a motivated and creative bartender to help fill out our team as we develop a new bar program. 

In addition to making and selling drinks, Bartenders participate in bar prep, which includes juicing, making syrups and batches. We're looking for someone eager both to play with exciting and different flavors as well as to contribute to a menu.
