Nate's Baked is Hiring! Growing downtown coffee shop, bakery and breakfast/lunch spot hiring experienced barista w/ highest standards in caring customer service, as well as interest in preparing refined salads, sandwiches, egg dishes, etc. Our shop is small, very friendly and our business is growing daily. We need someone with the flexibility to run between making coffees and ringing at the counter to assembling salads and keeping our cold case stocked with lunch and breakfast items as well as clearing tables and taking care of our guests. Working clean with a no-job-too-big (or small) attitude and ability to self-direct during down times a must. Potential for quick growth into a management role, as well as opportunity for fun off-site catering jobs. Please check out our website www.natesbakedaustin.com to familiarize yourself with our food and drink menu and contact us via email. Shifts 7 - 2 Monday thru Saturday.
