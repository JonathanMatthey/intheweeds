About The Brewer's Table:

A gathering place for community, The Brewer’s Table will offer a wood focused food and beer program that’s devoted to tradition and inspired by progression. A place where beer and food share the spotlight, it will be the very first wood fermented brewery in Texas. Leaving room for creative collaboration between brewer and chef, the menu thoughtfully pays tribute to seasonality and locality while embracing wood and its influence on food and drink.  Aiming to put forth approachable hospitality that’s best when enjoyed with others, the concept is slated to open in East Austin in March 2018. 

The Brewer's Table is an equal opportunity employer and values diversity in our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.
