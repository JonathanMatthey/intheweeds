Gourmands Neighborhood Pub is looking for a cook on the weekends and a couple of weekdays, as well as a closing cook in the evening. Preferably a good one, but we can train a bit if we need to. You'll have to do cleaning and dishes too. You'd be prepping soups and dressings from scratch, as well as veggies and slaws. Sandwiches, soups, apps and salads during service, with heavy use of a flat-top griddle.

So either drop by or send a resume via email with work history and references to be considered.

Thank you and we look forward to having you as a part of our family!
