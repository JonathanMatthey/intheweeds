Russian House of Austin is looking for kitchen staff! This restaurant serves authentic handmade Russian cuisine, in fact most of our staff speaks Russian. Speaking Russian is not a necessity, but helpful, as 80% of our staff speaks English well.
Kitchen is open 4pm - 9 pm on weekdays and 10am - 10 pm on weekends.
