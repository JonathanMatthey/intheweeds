Gourmands Neighborhood Pub is looking for a cook to work 40 hours a week, including weekends and nights. We will train you, but it would be great if you've worked in a kitchen before. You'll have to do cleaning and dishes for each shift. Sandwiches, soups, apps and salads during service, with heavy use of a flat-top griddle. The staff is generally laid back but gets their work done, and we would appreciate it if you were the same. Management is fair and actually listens to your needs for scheduling and working things around your life when possible. 

Gourmands is a popular sandwich and soup joint in East Austin with excellent reputation for food and is a great place to hang out, as well as work.

So either drop by or send a resume via email with work history and references to be considered!

Thank you and we look forward to having you as a part of our team!
