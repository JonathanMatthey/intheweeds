Cosmic Coffee + Beer Garden is a soon-to-open café and bar whose shared mission is to provide high quality coffee, cold craft beer, select cocktails, sustainable practices and exceptional service in a lush, beautiful permaculture inspired garden escape right off South Congress.

We seek warm, passionate, mature, and professional people who are looking to grow with us and ultimately be ambassadors of Cosmic. We're looking for experienced bartenders or baristas that are willing to learn to do both!

We offer competitive pay, flexible scheduling, and the opportunity to have your voice be a real part of what we do.  Start date early January.

If you’d like to learn more about the Cosmic space, our mission, or would like to meet with us, please send us a message and your résumé.
