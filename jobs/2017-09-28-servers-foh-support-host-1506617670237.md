Vigilante Gastropub and Games is your local nerd mecca. We serve over 200 board games alongside our scratch made small plates for a truly unique dining experience. We have a small, happy family here at Vigilante and we're looking for a couple of additions as we leap out of summer and into the busy season ahead. Are you passionate about tasty food and good service? Do you gather for weekly game nights with your friends? Do you want to be a part of an enthusiastic team dedicated to building the best gaming bar this city has ever seen? We just might be the place for you!
We need servers, a part-time host and a support/food runner. Our staff has access to the best technology including personalized i pads and individual "call for service" lights that take a lot of the leg work out of traditional serving. No experience? We're happy to train the right person!
