Looking for someone who has experience in kegging to grow our cold brew side of business. This individual would be primarily responsible for kegging, keg delivery (would be 5-gal mini slimline kegs) and on-site line cleaning and keg cooler upkeep. The program would be guided by the new hire. We have the coffee and cold brew recipe and YOU tell us what you need to be successful. There is plenty of growth potential and the compensation would be base plus commission on new clients/sales. We have coffee bagging and delivery hours in the short term to provide work/pay as you grow into the cold brew game.
