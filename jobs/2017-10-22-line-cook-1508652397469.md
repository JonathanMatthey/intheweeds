This position requires the ability to work all stations as well balance line and banquet prep. The schedule is fairly consistent with the exception of parties, brunches, weddings, etc. Not many late nights otherwise. We are trying to keep an eye towards fine dining and scratch cooking while still maintaining fast ticket times. Execution and efficiency are key. It's a small crew, and we need one more person to round it out. You will have the opportunity to help create specials and collaborate on dishes for wine dinners and other such events.
