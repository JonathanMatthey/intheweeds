Hosts/Servers/Bartenders
Hudson's Hill Country is currently seeking exceptional candidates to join our growing family. We aim to hold fast to old traditions and incorporate our own new flare. The expectation is to bring world class service and food to each of our guests. As part of our staff you will need to meet the following requirements:

   Hosts and hostesses are the first impression our guests will have and must be warm and inviting. Attention to detail and good organizational skills are a must.

  The servers we are looking for appreciate all of the small details that bring together great fine-dining. 5 years serving experience with a minimum of 1 year in fine dining is required for this position.

   Bartenders must have a solid wine, beer and liquor knowledge, must be personable and welcoming to guests, and able to thrive in a fast paced environment. A minimum of 3 years experience with 1 year in a fine dining establishment is required for this position.
