Gourmands Neighborhood Pub is looking for a cook with at least a year's experience in the kitchen. This position is medium volume and our kitchen is open, but minimal customer interaction if you're so inclined (but our customers are excellent so you may feel compelled). We are looking for someone who values presentation, cleanliness, and is reliable and punctual. All of our soups and most of our dressings are made from scratch. Our kitchen closes at midnight daily.


You MUST send a resume with work history and references to be considered.


Thank you and we look forward to having you as a part of our team!
