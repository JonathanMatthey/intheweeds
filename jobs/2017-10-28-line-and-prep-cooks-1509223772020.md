AM & PM Line Cooks
    
L’Oca d’Oro is looking for experienced, enthusiastic cooks to help us execute our  approachable reimaginings of hand-crafted Italian cuisine.  Our ethos is underpinned by a passion for hands-on community building.  We source locally, pay fairly, host genuinely and feed inclusively.  No pretension, no ego, just real, lovingly prepared food and gracious hospitality.  Our culinary team are dedicated to skill development without the romanticized back-of-house abuse typical of other refined dining establishments.  Our bread, pasta, salumi and cheese programs are robust and authentic. We create much of our pantry in-house using traditional methods.  We break down whole proteins, prepare produce with minimal manipulation, brew our own vinegars, and bottle our own amari.  Curious, collaborative chefs will find no shortage of opportunity to learn classic technique.
