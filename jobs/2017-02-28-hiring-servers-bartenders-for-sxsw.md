We are looking for a few key service hires (two bartenders, two servers) for a series of events during SXSW, schedule below. We're a unique, pop-up dining series and we're hosting dinners and cocktail parties during the Interactive part of the festival for 25-80 guests. 

Event Schedule (add at least a couple hours before/after for set up/clean up):
Friday 3/10 5-8pm
Saturday 3/11 1-4pm, 5-10pm
Sunday 3/12 1-4pm, 6-9pm

We have a guaranteed minimum pay rate per event, because we know it's a bit of a struggle to travel around Austin during the festival. All our events except Friday will be hosted at a residence in East Austin, so parking will be easy. On Friday our event is downtown, and we will help you with transportation & travel.

Our events are very professionally produced, but also a lot of fun. We look for partners who are smart, dependable, fast-moving, happy to be there, and have an all-hands-on-deck approach.
