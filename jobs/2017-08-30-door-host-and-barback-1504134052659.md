Craftsman is a neighborhood bar on East Cesar Chavez focusing on craft cocktails as well as craft and local beer in a relaxed environment. We are currently hiring P/T DOOR HOSTS and BAR BACKS.

We are looking for outgoing, energetic people to join our team and grow with us. 

Door host is more of a guest relations position than a security one. Anyone who is fun, friendly, and outgoing with a strong work ethic is the ideal candidate.

We look forward to hearing from you!
