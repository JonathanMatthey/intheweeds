Trudy's is currently vamping up for our busiest season of the year and running a new hire special for all employees hired in the month of March. Every employee hired this month who works here for at least six months will receive a bonus of $400. This is for all locations, not simply the South location. To qualify for this bonus all you need to do is put my name, Zaneta Whitten, as your reference in hearing about the job so I can track this bonus upon hiring you. We are hiring for all FOH positions.
