The Beer Plant is looking to add skilled and passionate individuals to our growing team. As a line cook, the following expectations must be met on a daily basis: set-up your station for successful service, communicate any immediate needs to Kitchen Supervisors, continuously prep product while maintaining station during service, maintain high standard for food quality and presentation, recognize when to ask for assistance from others, work in a clean and efficient manner, and set the next shift up for success (i.e. prep/refill station, sweep and maintain floors, take out trash, sanitize service areas, etc.)
