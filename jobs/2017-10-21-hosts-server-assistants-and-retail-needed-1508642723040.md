Jacoby's is looking for hosts, buses and mercantile associates for the holiday season! Our hours are nights mainly, so it is a great income to supplement if you need extra cash. All positions are hourly, but hosts and server assistants are tipped out positions. Jacoby's is closed Sunday PM, and all day Monday. We occasionally do have private events. 

Hosts are needed for brunch (weekends only) and some shifts through the week. Server assistants are needed for full time hours. Please send your resume to Aamber766@gmail.com.
