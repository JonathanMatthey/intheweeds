Roppolo's Pizzeria is on the lookout for prompt, dependable, hardworking and FUN people interested in a part time, late night job. START TRAINING IMMEDIATELY!!!

I REPEAT...these are part time late night positions...weekends must be open and flexible...meaning you will usually be scheduled two or three shifts a week and will be expected to work until 3:30 am or a bit later. (we do have a schedule request book, so don't let that scare you).

Cashier positions are available giving you an opportunity to work in a fast paced environment in the entertainment district where you never know who you will be preparing pizza for...get ready to crank out some of the best pizza in Texas!!! You could be working in one of our brick and mortars or one of our mobile trailers around downtown.
