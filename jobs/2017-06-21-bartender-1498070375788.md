We are a cool kitchen and bar on the eastside.  We feature 2 large outdoor patios and a craft cocktail program.  We are looking for strong, outgoing, and energetic bartenders to join our team.  Bartenders must have craft cocktail, craft beer, and high volume experience. Must be knowledgeable about spirits and flavor profiles. Must care about hospitality and creating a unique experience for guests.  Bartenders are expected to use social media to help promote the bar and themselves.  

We have a full kitchen and are counter-service.  Bartenders are required to take food orders.  On slower nights, you will be expected to run food and bus tables.  You will be expected to get out from behind the bar and communicate to guests.  

We are opening a new location in a few months, so bartenders with management experience are encouraged to apply.  We also have other bars around town, so there is opportunity for growth in the company.
