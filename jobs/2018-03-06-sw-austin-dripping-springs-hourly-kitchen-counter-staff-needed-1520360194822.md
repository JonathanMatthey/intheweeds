Winner Winner is a brand new scratch kitchen with take away counter service.
We have hourly kitchen and counter service positions available for folks who take pride in a job well done. We’re a small, neighborhood operation, and we like it that way.  Our goal is to put together a solid staff family that takes care of each other as well as the customer.  We believe that our staff is our most important asset, because if the staff is happy to be there, the customer will be too.  
You’ll need a car, industry experience, and attention to detail.
