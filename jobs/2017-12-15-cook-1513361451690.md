An i Fratelli Pizza cook operates the kitchen in its entirety, from prep to cooking orders to cleaning. I'd argue it's much easier than your typical kitchen because the only equipment you use to cook is a double stack stone deck oven. No fryers or open grills. The hardest part of the job(from experience), is rolling our fresh dough into our signature "squoval" shape.
