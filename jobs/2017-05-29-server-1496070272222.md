Seeking a seasoned, dedicated server with at least 3-5 years of serving experience and thorough food and wine knowledge. Must be able to handle high-volume service and wear many hats (server, busser, host, food runner). Currently hiring for dinner shifts Monday-Saturday (closed Sunday); however, an open schedule for occasional day shifts is preferred.

La Traviata is a locally and family-owned Italian restaurant in the heart of downtown Austin. We have a small, tight-knit staff that prides itself on working as a team to give superior service. Only serious applicants that want to join our family need apply.
