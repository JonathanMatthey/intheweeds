Hello! I am looking for an Assistant Restaurant/Bar Supervisor for the PM shift at the Austin Doubletree by Hilton. The Hilton is a great company to work for with amazing benefits. Also, it is a great opportunity to take that leap into management and hotels. Previous bartending/supervising experience would be great but not required.
