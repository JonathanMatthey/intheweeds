Need servers and hosts!

Hosts - Very simple job, great way to pick up some extra cash. $10/hr + free meal! We use Resy, but willing to train.

Servers - Least amount of side work you'll ever do! Looking for seasoned veterans only! We are a team of industry veterans who enjoy a busy restaurant with a low-maintenance clientele and zero drama. NO AM SHIFTS! Wine knowledge is a strong plus, but willing to train excellent personalities.
