BARTENDER - Bartender must have Beer, craft cocktail, and high volume experience. Must be knowledgeable about spirits and flavor profiles. 

Must care about hospitality and creating a unique experience for guests.  We are a neighborhood bar, so bartenders need to get out from behind the bar to check on guests.  Looking for individuals that want to make their bar the best it can be by paying attention to everyday details. 

Must have open availability, especially on weekends.  Opportunity for management to right individuals.
