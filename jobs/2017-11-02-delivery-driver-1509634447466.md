To deliver Sushi to our guests.  It is pretty self explanatory.  We are looking for some friendly drivers that are able to work on the weekends and at night.  

Perks of the job are that Sushi Zushi provides the vehicles.  We have our own fleet of cars so there is no wear and tear on your vehicle.  We also pay for the gas, car wash and any maintenance that is required.  Plus all of our vehicles have blue tooth for easy GPS and to rock out to your favorite music while you are on a run.  

There is also very minimal side work.  Side works consists of making to go portions of Soy and Joy sauce and ginger and wasabi.
