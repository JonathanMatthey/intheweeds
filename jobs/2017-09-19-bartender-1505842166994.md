Looking for seasonal bartenders for events all around Austin & surrounding cities.  Events range from private house parties, to weddings, to festivals, and everything in-between.

Some events require just showing up and slinging drinks, others can require anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours of setup, and 30 minutes to an hour of breakdown, so quickly getting the scope of the requirements upon arrival and taking the initiative to get things done quickly is a must.
