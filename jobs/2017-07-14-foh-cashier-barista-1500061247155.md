Now hiring FOH. Duties include cashiering, running food, bussing tables, barista, and sidework. Ideal candidates will have serving experience and coffee knowledge but if you don't have coffee knowledge we will train you! The $$ is good and our staff is close knit. Part time available and could transition to full time when our new location opens.
