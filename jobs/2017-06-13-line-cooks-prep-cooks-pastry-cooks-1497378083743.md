We are looking for talented culinary staff to join our opening team at Tiny Boxwoods Austin. The Austin store will sit at Kerbey Lane and 35th Street nestled next to Kerbey Lane Village and the charming Bryker Woods neighborhood. Just like Tiny Boxwoods in Houston, Tinys Austin will overlook a sprawling lawn pad and patio and will serve breakfast, lunch, dinner and brunch on the weekends.

We have built our brand-new kitchen to be a place that our cooks want to come to every day to work. We want it to inspire them! Our chefs cook all our meats and fishes in our 800-degree wood burning oven. An in-house bakery home to our chocolate chip cookie, homemade jams, house pickles, aioli from scratch are just a few of the items we hang our hat on when it comes to our Chef driven culture. We're all about quality and it shows in our hands-on approach.
 
Our managers are focused on setting our staff up for success and continuing to build on our positive work environment. Our restaurants are a home away from home and we are so much more than just a dining establishment. We're looking for the best who want to grow with the company. We look forward in meeting you!
