We're looking for a part time cook at our laid back neighborhood bar. We have a food truck that operates as our kitchen. The bartenders take orders at the bar and tickets print up in the kitchen. When the order is ready our cooks bring the food up to the bar and hands it to the customer with any extra condiments they may need. 

On average we sell about 70-100 items on all tickets each day.
