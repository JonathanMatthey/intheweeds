Looking to add a few good people to help out with door/support/security at one of Rainey Streets busiest bars. Duties include checking IDs, icing down wells, cleaning glassware, maintaining garbage, crowd control, etc. Weekend availability a must. 

Also looking for 1-2 part time bartenders, mainly for the weekends. Daytime availability on Sat/Sun a must. High volume experience preferred.
