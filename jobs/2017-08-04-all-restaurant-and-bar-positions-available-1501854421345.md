We are opening up Austin's largest, most-anticipated new hotel and we are looking for absolute ROCK STARS to join our team! Opening in the Fall, Fairmont Austin will feature F&B offerings that push the limits of what you expect from a luxury hotel. Forget what you think you know about lobby bars- Fulton is the centerpiece of our main level, featuring inventive cocktails and an authentically Austin atmosphere. Rules & Regs, located on our beautiful rooftop, is an indoor/outdoor concept featuring Austin's hottest pool and bar scene. Our all-star Culinary team will be featuring amazing offerings in both Garrison (our twist on a grill) and Revue, a food experience like Austin has never seen. Join us as a Server, Bartender, Barback, Food Runner, Host or one of the many others positions available, and do more than just go to work every day- be a part of changing the Austin food landscape!
