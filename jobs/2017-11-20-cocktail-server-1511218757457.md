Looking for an experienced individual who is looking to join our team. We are seeking someone who can balance a laid back, but fast paced atmosphere. You would be responsible for maintaining a clean floor and supplying your customer with fast, friendly service. Looking for part time time at the moment, but could very quickly move to full time depending on the individual and their needs. Familiarity with Aloha and Billiards is preferred, but not required. And no, you donâ€™t have to wear a uniform.
