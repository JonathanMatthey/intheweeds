                please contact us at: kc@intheweedsjobs.com .</p>
            <p>3. Types of Data We Collect. We collect personal information from users, as described below.
                <br/>
            <p>(a) Information You Provide to Us.
            <ul>
                <li>We may collect personal information from you, such as your first and last name, e-mail,
                    (“Account“).
                </li>
                <li>When you upload your user name, profile photo and any other information you choose to make public on
                    your public profile page, such as your resume, skills, and work experience, (“Profile”) the
                    information contained in your posting will be stored in our servers and other users may be able to
                    see it. The information that you provide in your Profile will be visible to others, including
                    anonymous visitors of the Site.
                </li>
                <li>When you order Services on our Site, we will collect all information necessary to complete the
                    transaction, including your name, credit card information, and billing information.
                </li>
                <li>If you tell us where you are (e.g., by allowing your mobile device to send us your location), we may
                    store and use that information to provide you with location-based information.
                </li>
                <li>If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address,
                    as well as any other content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply.
                    When you participate in one of our surveys, we may collect additional profile information.
                </li>
                <li>If you participate in a sweepstakes, contest or giveaway on our Site, we may ask you for your e-mail
                    address and/or home number (to notify you if you win or not). We may also ask for first and last
                    names, and sometimes post office addresses to verify your identity. In some situations we may need
                    additional information as a part of the entry process, such as a prize selection choice. These
                    sweepstakes and contests are voluntary. We recommend that you read the rules for each sweepstakes
                    and contest that you enter.
                </li>
                <li>We may also collect personal information, such as at other points in our Service that state that
                    personal information is being collected.
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>(b) Information You Provide to Facebook and other Social Networking Sites. The Services allow users to
                access Facebook to interact with friends and to share on Facebook through Wall and friends’ News Feeds.
                If you are already logged into the Services and Facebook or another social networking service (“SNS”),
                when you click on “Connect with Facebook,” or a similar connection on another SNS, you will be prompted
                to merge your profiles. If you are already logged into the Services but not logged into Facebook or
                another SNS that we support, when you click on “Connect with Facebook,” or a similar connection on
                another SNS, you will be prompted to enter your SNS credentials or to “Sign Up” for the SNS. By
                proceeding, you are allowing the Services to access your information and you are agreeing to the
                Facebook or other SNS’s Terms of Use in your use of the Services. Conversely, if you are not currently
                registered as a user of the Services, and you click on “Sign in” using Facebook or another SNS that we
                support, you will first be asked to enter your Facebook or SNS credentials and then be given the option
                to register for the Services. In this case, we may receive information from Facebook or another SNS to
                make it easier for you to create an Account on the Site and show our relevant content from your Facebook
                or SNS friends. Once you register on the Site and connect with Facebook or another SNS, you will be able
                to automatically post recent activity back to Facebook or the other SNS. Any information that we collect
                from your Facebook or other SNS account may depend on the privacy settings you have with that SNS, so
                please consult the SNS’s privacy and data practices. If you signed up using Facebook Connect or another
                SNS account would like to disable or disconnect it entirely, or sign up using another method, please
                contact us at: kc@intheweedsjobs.com</p>
            <p>(c) Information Collected via Technology.
            <ul>
                <li>Log Files. As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in
                    log files. This information includes IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (“ISP”),
                    referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this
                    information to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users’ movements around the Site, gather
                    demographic information about our user base as a whole, and better tailor our Services to our users’
                    needs. Except as noted in this Privacy Policy, we do not link this automatically-collected data to
                    personal information.
                </li>
                <li>Cookies. Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information. “Cookies” are small
                    pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing the
                    website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and
                    persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more
                    personal and interactive experience on our Service. This type of information is collected to make
                    the Service more useful to you and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests
                    and needs.
                </li>
                <li>Mobile Services. We may also collect non-personal information from your mobile device if you have
                    downloaded our Application(s). This information is generally used to help us deliver the most
                    relevant information to you. Examples of information that may be collected and used include your
                    geographic location, how you use the Application(s), and information about the type of device you
                    use. In addition, in the event our Application(s) crash on your mobile device, we will receive
                    information about your mobile device model software version and device carrier, which allows us to
                    identify and fix bugs and otherwise improve the performance of our Application(s). This information
                    is sent to us as aggregated information and is not traceable to any individual and cannot be used to
                    identify an individual.
                </li>
                <li>Traffic Analytics. We use a number of third party service provides, such as Google Analytics, to
                    help analyze how users use the Service (“Analytics Companies”). These Analytics Companies uses
                    Cookies to collect information such as how often users visit the Service, and what other sites they
                    used prior to coming to the Site. We use the information we get from these Analytics Companies only
                    to improve our Site and Services. These Analytics Companies collect only the IP address assigned to
                    you on the date you visit the Service, rather than your name or other personally identifying
                    information. We do not combine the information generated through the use of our Analytics Companies
                    with your personal information. Although these Analytics Companies may plant a persistent Cookie on
                    your web browser or mobile device to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit the
                    Service, the Cookie cannot be used by anyone but the Analytics Company that placed the applicable
                    Cookie. This Policy does not apply to and we are not responsible for the Cookies used by these
                    Analytics Companies.
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>(d) Information Collected from You About Others. If you decide to invite a third party to create an
                Account, we will collect your and the third party’s names and email addresses in order to send an email
                and follow up with the third party. We rely upon you to obtain whatever consents from the third party
                that may be required by law to allow us to access and upload the third party’s names and email addresses
                as required above. You or the third party may contact us at kc@intheweedsjobs.com to request removal of
                this information from our database.</p>
            <p>4. Use of Your Personal information.</p>
            <p>(a) General Use. In general, personal information you submit to us is used either to respond to requests
                that you make, or to aid us in serving you better. We use your personal information in the following
                ways:

                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>(b) User Feedback. We often receive comments from users who have had positive experiences with our
                Services. We may post user feedback on the Site from time to time. We will share your feedback with your
                first name and last initial only. If we choose to post your first and last name along with your
                feedback, we will obtain your consent prior to posting you name with your feedback.
                <br/><br/>
                (c) Creation of Anonymous Data. We may create anonymous data records from personal information by
                excluding information (such as your name) that makes the data personally identifiable to you. We use
                this anonymous data to analyze request and usage patterns so that we may enhance the content of our
                Services and improve navigation. We reserve the right to use anonymous data for any purpose and disclose
                anonymous data to third parties in our sole discretion.
            </p>
            <p>5. Disclosure of Your Personal information. We disclose your personal information as described below and
                as described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.
                <br/>
                (a)Third Parties Designated by You. When you use the Services, the personal information you provide will
                be shared with the third parties that you designate to receive such information.
                <br/>
                (b) Third Party Service Providers. We may share your personal information with third party service
                providers to: provide you with the Services that we offer you through our Site; to conduct quality
                assurance testing; to facilitate creation of accounts; to provide technical support; and/or to provide
                other services to the Company. These third party service providers are required not to use your personal
                information other than to provide the services requested by Company.
                <br/>
                (c) Corporate Restructuring. We may share some or all of your personal information in connection with or
                during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition or dissolution, transaction or proceeding
                involving sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion of our business or assets. In
                the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, personal information may also be transferred as
                a business asset. If another company acquires our company, business, or assets, that company will
                possess the personal information collected by us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding
                your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.
                <br/>
                (d) Public Profiles. Certain portions of the information you explicitly provide to us may also be
                displayed in your Profile, such as your user name and profile photo. By default your Profile is set for
                public viewing. We may display this content on the Services and further distribute it to a wider
                audience through third party sites and services. Once displayed on publicly viewable web pages, that
                information can be collected and used by others. We cannot control who reads your postings or what other
                users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so it is very important that you do not put
                personal information in your posts. Once you have posted information publicly, while you will still be
                able to edit and delete it on the Services, you will not be able to edit or delete such information
                cached, collected and stored elsewhere by others (e.g. search engines).
                <br/>
                (e) Social Networking Sites. Some of our Applications and Services may enable you to post content to
                SNSs (e.g., Facebook or Google+). If you choose to do this, we will provide information to such SNSs in
                accordance with your elections. You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for your use
                of those websites and that it is your responsibility to review the terms of use and privacy policy of
                the third party provider of such SNSs. We will not be responsible or liable for: (i) the availability or
                accuracy of such SNSs; (ii) the content, products or services on or availability of such SNSs; or (iii)
                your use of any such SNSs.
                <br/>
                (f) Other Disclosures. Regardless of any choices you make regarding your personal information (as
                described below), Company may disclose personal information if it believes in good faith that such
                disclosure is necessary (i) in connection with any legal investigation; (ii) to comply with relevant
                laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on Company; (iii) to protect or defend the rights or
                property of Company or users of the Services; and/or (iv) to investigate or assist in preventing any
                violation or potential violation of the law, this Privacy Policy, or our Terms of Use.
            </p>
            <p>6. How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals. Some web browsers may transmit “do not track” signals to the
                websites and other online services with which your web browser communicates. There is no standard that
                governs what, if anything, websites should do when they receive these signals. We currently do not take
                action in response to these signals. If and when a standard is established, we may revise our policy on
                responding to these signals.</p>
            <p>7. Your Choices Regarding Your Information. You have several choices regarding use of information on our
                Services:
                <br/>
                (a) Email Communications. We will periodically send you free newsletters and e-mails that directly
                promote the use of our Services. When you receive newsletters or promotional communications from us, you
                may indicate a preference to stop receiving further communications from us and you will have the
                opportunity to “opt-out” by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the e-mail you receive or
                by contacting us directly (please see contact information below). Despite your indicated e-mail
                preferences, we may send you service-related communications, including notices of any updates to our
                Terms of Use or Privacy Policy.
                <br/>
                (b) Changing or Deleting Your Personal Information. You may change any of your personal information in
                your Account by editing your Profile within your Account or by sending an email to us at the address
                listed above. You may requested deletion of your personal information by us, and we will use
                commercially reasonable efforts to honor your request, but please note that we may be required to keep
                such information and not delete it (or to keep this information for a certain time, in which case we
                will comply with your deletion request only after we have fulfilled such requirements). When we delete
                any information, it will be deleted from the active database, but may remain in our archives. We may
                also retain your information for fraud prevention or similar purposes.
                <br/>
                (c) De-Linking SNS. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to have your SNS account (e.g.,
                Facebook) linked to your Account, contact us at kc@intheweedsjobs.com. You may also manage the sharing
                of certain personal information with us when you connect with us through an SNS, such as through
                Facebook Connect. Please refer to the privacy settings of the SNS to determine how you may adjust our
                permissions and manage the interactivity between the Services and your social media account or mobile
                device.
                <br/>
                (d) Applications. You can stop all collection of information by the Application(s) by uninstalling the
                Application(s). You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your mobile
                device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.
            </p>
            <p>8. Security of Your Personal information. Company is committed to protecting the security of your
                personal information. We use a variety of industry-standard security technologies and procedures to help
                protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We also require you to
                enter a password to access your Account information. Please do not disclose your Account password to
                unauthorized people. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is
                100% secure, however. Therefore, while Company uses reasonable efforts to protect your personal
                information, Company cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
            <p>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is subject to occasional revision, and if we make
                any material changes in the way we use your personal information, we will notify you by sending you an
                e-mail to the last e-mail address you provided to us and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes
